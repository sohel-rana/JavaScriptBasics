### JavaScript Basics

This repository is inspired by the book "JavaScript: The Good Parts" written by Douglas Crockford.
The examples shown in the book are implemented as a complete and independently runnable codes.


### How to run

You can run the examples in several ways. But I would recommend to use browser's console.
Just open a file and copy the content in the browser's console. Then modify and check the output. 

Also you can use node for running the examples. Simply run "node <filename.js>"


Happy Coding :)
